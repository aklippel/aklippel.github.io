        <h1>My Top 5 Albums of 2020</h1>

        <h2>#1 Sawayama by Rina Sawayama</h2>

                <a href='https://open.spotify.com/album/3stadz88XVpHcXnVYMHc4J?si=H_XzfiZbQWeEN5Fq8nvAdw'>Sawayama</a> is the debut album of Rina Sawayama. 
                Sawayama offers an eclectic range of pop songs, exploring themes such as identity, belonging, and consumerism.
                While some critics have criticized the album’s lack of unity, I find that the tension between each track’s pop subgenera contributes the Sawayama’s 
                overall story of feeling trapped between her Japanese and British identities.
            </p>
            <p>
                My top three tracks include <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/32umfTzGdXsWOTNaRGR5hd?si=QqDKQHw1QCanvc3vPQrSag'>Akasaka Sad</a>, 
                <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/32umfTzGdXsWOTNaRGR5hd?si=ombK2LUCTe2pHdKCtN3BtA'>Who's Gonna Save U Now?</a>,

                Sophie Allison, known by her stage name, Soccer Mommy, released her second studio album, <a href='https://open.spotify.com/album/2CISL0rSGzbO0MbQMlqBez?si=6dc9Fh01RZq7g3NO-WsoxQ'>color theory</a>
                in Febuary of 2020. color theory offers a mid-tempo, 2000s pop inspired, indie rock album that leads its listeners through the colored phases of Sophie Allison's own emotional introspection.
                Dropping just a few short weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic forced myself and much of the country into a lockdown, color theory struck a well-timed chord 
                with me. <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/2drtd6SptpMJ1KylMQ7mrE?si=NlX7blOZRSWrRJGxaGhYJQ'>circle the drain</a> was an early favorite of mine off the album.

                    this solo project was highly anticipated by fans of Bridger's debut,

                    that have become her signiture. <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/49UDOG8DoBajXTJSTqfRMg?si=5z8Y08PJSi-cjdrrftuxAg'>Kyoto</a> presents a more
                    upbeat option, but hits with the bittersweetness of Bridger's strained relationship with her father.

                    New Zealand rock group The Beth's sophmore album, Jump Rope Gazers, was released in 2020. After the title track offtheir debut album, 
                    <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/0hY72avNehvdV7YVBEH4oo?si=dSe6aMD-Tc2-5EGb1OIgpg'>Future Me Hates Me</a>, earned the
                    title of my most played track of 2019, I knew I would have to give <a href='https://open.spotify.com/album/5rwWTJEIAyzBbRjEU0BTfA?si=oc6IGu2eQFOzIbuwV9u6WA'>Jump Rope Gazers</a>
                    a spin. In their previous body of work, The Beth's greatest strength has been their cheeky, high-tempo, rock anthems. This album delivered this with
                    <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/47oZ0qG4QF9IFi0h3ywgww?si=_qpnqV-5Q4m9HSm4ylv1YQ'>Dying to Believe</a>, while treading into new territory with 
                    the much calmer <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/186IaAWMAYYlpSvzvJEDNA?si=ifOaZgGkSiOMOmhAJGWUTQ'>Do You Want Me Now?</a> and 
                    <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/44FMZo6Wij3Il6uuiiB9Oq?si=qX4VkYB6QpKul2-O-Ah4Zw'>You Are a Beam of Light</a>. T
                    he Beths' sound has always offered me a strange nostalgia. Despite not quite living up to their debut album, Jump Rope Gazers 
                    stays consistent with delivering to that sound, despite slowing down their songs.

        <h2>#5 Moddern Jonny Sings: Songs in the Age of Vibe by Theo Katzman</h2>
        <div class='music-image'>

                <a href='https://open.spotify.com/album/5uV5cai6VPXvq9fmtvlRWn?si=rCvo3S6OR2GzIgdhcnwIkg'>Modern Johnny Sings: Songs in the Age of Vibe</a>
                is Theo Katzman's third studio album. However, most of his musical success has come from performing with <a href='https://vulfpeck.com/'>Vulfpeck</a>,
                a jazz-funk rhythm section Katzman joined while a music student at the University of Michigan. Modern Johnny offers some of the silly, and in this case slightly
                 political, songs Vulfpeck has become known for, with <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/1aEcZKCwqln3s3VvY5Kwxl?si=Xv9rXyjgSEmftZRis7c2Aw'>You Could Be President</a>
                 and <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/3NfT4L2Tg4h7e9XVRAGRzX?si=Bbn2nMvPQ1yFvhpPImwrvg'>(I Don't Want to Be A) Billionaire</a>. However,
                 where Katzman's songwriting strengths lie is with his "Heartbreak Hits," a phrase he used as the title for his second album.
                </p>
                <p>
                 
                 For me, the runaway track is <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/1U1OeyPu6frcUUrSZ14PjH?si=sIYalkOYReu2iT1oo0Ogbw'>What Did You Mean (When You Said Love)</a>.
                 Simple and fairly stripped, this track pulls heavy emotional punches with its lyrics. My other top tracks include <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/3WJ9kGj30zXsIEEo1fdKfv?si=qrpcxcdRR1mE992rF70r3A'>The Death of Us</a> 
                 and <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/5kuVlCXrDTcfz1DfqQjhen?si=zajUiefGRzqPBR6T9NnP9A'>Hardly Ever Rains</a>.
